# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Add audio statistics and scan status improvements**:
  - Distinguish between "no audio" videos (successful scan) and genuine errors during loudness scanning
  - Add separate counters for no-audio files vs errors in scan status messages
  - Improve scan progress updates: update every file with throttling (max once per 100ms) instead of every 50 files
  - Add `HasAudio` property to loudness metadata to track audio presence
  - Add backward compatibility handling for existing loudness stats without `HasAudio` field
  - Fix: Videos with -91.0 dB loudness (placeholder value) now correctly marked as no-audio
  - Add global audio statistics: "Videos with audio" and "Videos without audio" counts in Stats panel
  - Add current video audio stats: "Has audio" status and loudness/peak dB values in Stats panel
- **Add audio filter mode for playback**:
  - New filter modes: Play all, Only with audio, Only without audio
  - Audio filter settings moved to Playback menu
  - Filter persists in playback settings and applies to random/queue selection
  - Direct play actions (favorites, blacklist, etc.) always work regardless of filter mode
- **Improve volume normalization algorithm**:
  - Increase target loudness from -18.0 dB to -16.0 dB for better perceived volume
  - Increase max gain adjustment from ±12.0 dB to ±20.0 dB for very quiet videos
  - Add peak-based limiter to prevent loud videos from exceeding -3.0 dB (prevents clipping/distortion)
  - Use PeakDb data to inform limiting decisions alongside MeanVolumeDb
  - Refactor normalization calculation into single helper method for consistency
- **Add FFmpeg logging window**:
  - New "Show FFmpeg logs" option in View menu
  - Displays detailed FFmpeg execution logs (exit codes, output, results) in separate non-modal window
  - Includes Copy Logs and Clear buttons for debugging loudness scanning issues
  - Auto-refreshes every 2 seconds to show new logs during scanning
- **UI improvements**:
  - Remove "(all libraries)" suffix from global stats labels for cleaner display
  - Add peak dB display to current video stats in Stats panel
- **Add volume normalization system** with four modes:
  - Off: No normalization (direct volume control)
  - Simple: Real-time normalization using LibVLC `normvol` audio filter only
  - Library-aware: Per-file loudness adjustment only (no real-time filter)
  - Advanced: Both per-file loudness adjustment and real-time normalization
- Add loudness scanning feature: scan video library to measure mean volume and peak levels per file
- Add persistent loudness statistics storage (loudnessStats.json)
- Add volume normalization menu controls in Playback menu
- Add "Scan loudness…" option in Library menu for per-file loudness analysis
- Extend NativeBinaryHelper with GetFFmpegPath() for loudness scanning
- Library-aware and Advanced modes automatically adjust volume per-file based on scanned loudness data
- Fix: Switching normalization modes during playback now properly recreates media with correct options
- Fix: Mute button now correctly preserves user volume preference instead of normalized volume value
- **Improve duration scanning reliability**:
  - Replace TagLib# duration scanning with FFprobe for significantly improved reliability (works on virtually all video formats)
  - Fix thread-safety issues in semaphore initialization and permit leak in duration scanning
- **Bundle native dependencies**:
  - Bundle FFprobe and LibVLC native libraries to eliminate external dependencies
  - Add NativeBinaryHelper for platform-aware binary path resolution with caching
  - Add license attribution for bundled third-party components (GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1)
- **Performance improvements**:
  - Move loop restart work off the UI thread to reduce freezes when videos restart
